        Color Palette

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  
      You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Open Sans <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I choose Open Sans, because it is a font that seems modern and also sober.
        In this case I'm combining two similar sans-serif fonts.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Montserrat <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Montserrat is a sans-serif font, I look for pairing suggestions for Open Sans and
        I think montserrat is a good modern one.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
